# Non-fungible token contract in JavaScript

This is an equivalent JavaScript implementation of the non-fungible token example. Every user can send and receive a non-fungible token.

## Build the contract

First ensure JSVM contract is build and deployed locally, follow [Local Installation](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-js#local-installation). Then run:
```
npm i
npm run build
```

## Test the contract with workspaces-js
```
npm run test
```
